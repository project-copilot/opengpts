## Title
AI Model Comparison Framework for OpenGPTs

## Description

Objectives:

Develop a system to compare different AI models using common documents and predefined questions.

Focus on metrics like ROUGE-1 and G-Eval scores to evaluate model performance.

Enable users to make informed decisions about LLM selection.

Scope:

In-scope: Development of a framework to load documents, ask predefined questions, and compare model responses using ROUGE-1 and G-Eval scores.

Out-of-scope: Advanced deepeval features, multiple file handling, and integration with cognitive architectures (these are for future expansion).

Key Initiatives:

1. *Document Loading Module*: Create a module to load and preprocess documents for model comparison.
2. *Question-Answering Interface*: Develop an interface to ask predefined questions to different models.
3. *Response Comparison Engine*: Implement an engine to compare model responses using ROUGE-1 and G-Eval scores.
4. *Console Output and Summary*: Generate a console output displaying comparison metrics and a summary.

User Stories:
1. *Title*: Document Loading Module

*Description*: Users can load a single text file containing information for model comparison.

*Relation Type*: None

*Key*: US1

*Story Point Estimate*: 3

2. *Title*: Question-Answering Interface

*Description*: Users can input predefined questions to be asked to both models.

*Relation Type*: Depends on US1

*Key*: US2

*Story Point Estimate*: 5

3. *Title*: Response Comparison Engine

*Description*: The system compares the models' responses using ROUGE-1 and G-Eval scores.

*Relation Type*: Depends on US2

*Key*: US3

*Story Point Estimate*: 8

4. *Title*: Console Output and Summary

*Description*: The system outputs the comparison metrics and a summary to the console.

*Relation Type*: Depends on US3

*Key*: US4

*Story Point Estimate*: 3

Acceptance Criteria:

*Document Loading Module*: Successfully loads and preprocesses a text file.

*Question-Answering Interface*: Allows input of predefined questions and sends them to both models.

*Response Comparison Engine*: Accurately calculates and displays ROUGE-1 and G-Eval scores.

*Console Output and Summary*: Outputs a clear and concise summary of the comparison metrics.

Implementation Strategy:

1. *Phase 1*: Develop the Document Loading Module.

Implement file loading and preprocessing functions.

Test with sample text files.

2. *Phase 2*: Build the Question-Answering Interface.

Develop the interface for inputting and sending questions.

Integrate with the Document Loading Module.

3. *Phase 3*: Implement the Response Comparison Engine.

Develop functions to calculate ROUGE-1 and G-Eval scores.

Integrate with the Question-Answering Interface.

4. *Phase 4*: Create Console Output and Summary.

Develop functions to generate and display comparison metrics.

Integrate with the Response Comparison Engine.

Milestones:

*Milestone 1*: Completion of Document Loading Module (Week 1)

*Milestone 2*: Completion of Question-Answering Interface (Week 3)

*Milestone 3*: Completion of Response Comparison Engine (Week 6)

*Milestone 4*: Completion of Console Output and Summary (Week 7)

Dependencies:

*Dependency 1*: Availability of predefined questions and sample text files.

*Dependency 2*: Access to Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT-4 models.

*Dependency 3*: Integration with the deepeval library for metric calculations.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

*Risk 1*: Delays in accessing models (Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT-4).

*Mitigation*: Secure access early in the project and have backup models available.

*Risk 2*: Inaccurate metric calculations.

*Mitigation*: Conduct thorough testing and validation of the Response Comparison Engine.

*Risk 3*: Integration issues with the deepeval library.

*Mitigation*: Collaborate closely with the deepeval development team and allocate time for integration testing.
