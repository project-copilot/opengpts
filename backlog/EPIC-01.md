## Title
Implement G-Eval Tests on OpenGPTs

## Description

Objective:
The primary goal of this epic is to enhance the OpenGPTs UI by integrating G-Eval tests. This feature will allow users to define custom evaluation criteria, input questions, and expected answers, and obtain a comprehensive evaluation score for their RAG Bot's performance. By providing a robust evaluation framework, we aim to improve the accuracy and reliability of the RAG Bot, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and trust in the system.

Scope:
This epic includes several key initiatives:

Configuration Panel: Develop a user-friendly interface where users can set up custom evaluation criteria, including input questions and expected answers.

Evaluation Engine: Implement the backend logic to process the defined criteria and generate evaluation scores for the RAG Bot's performance.

Reporting and Feedback: Create detailed reports that provide insights into the evaluation results, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.

Integration with Existing Systems: Ensure seamless integration with the current OpenGPTs infrastructure to support the new evaluation features.

User Documentation: Develop comprehensive documentation and tutorials to guide users in setting up and utilizing the G-Eval tests effectively.

Acceptance Criteria:

Successful implementation of the configuration panel with intuitive user experience.

Accurate and reliable evaluation scores generated by the evaluation engine.

Positive feedback from users on the ease of use and usefulness of the evaluation reports.

Seamless integration with existing OpenGPTs systems without any performance degradation.

Availability of clear and helpful user documentation.

Implementation Strategy:

The strategy involves a phased approach to developing and rolling out the G-Eval tests feature. Each phase will follow Agile methodologies, with continuous integration and deployment to allow for iterative testing and refinement based on user feedback and performance metrics.

Milestones:

Research and Planning: Gather requirements and insights from users to inform the design of the configuration panel and evaluation engine.

Development and Testing: Implement the configuration panel, evaluation engine, and reporting features in stages, ensuring thorough testing for usability and accuracy.

Launch and Evaluation: Roll out the G-Eval tests feature to users, monitor usage and feedback, and make necessary adjustments for continuous improvement.

Dependencies:

Collaboration between product management, development, UX/UI design, and QA teams.

Integration with existing OpenGPTs infrastructure for data processing and storage.

Use of analytics tools to measure the effectiveness and user satisfaction of the new features post-launch.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

User Resistance: Monitor user feedback closely and be prepared to iterate on the configuration panel and evaluation criteria based on user input.

Technical Challenges: Ensure robust testing and have contingency plans for rollbacks if issues arise.

Performance Impact: Optimize the evaluation engine and reporting features for minimal impact on system performance and responsiveness.
