## Title
Integrate Claude 2 into our RAG bot framework

## Description
User:
As a developer

Action:
I want to integrate Claude 2 into our RAG bot framework

Outcome:
So that I can create a bot that offers an alternative to GPT-4

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The developer should be able to access and configure Claude 2 within the RAG bot framework.
2. The system should support the integration of Claude 2, allowing it to function as an alternative to GPT-4.
3. The system should ensure that Claude 2 can handle the same types of queries and tasks as GPT-4.
4. The system should provide a seamless switch between using Claude 2 and GPT-4, based on user preference or system configuration.

Technical Reference:

The integration of Claude 2 into the RAG bot framework requires changes to both the back-end and front-end components. The back-end will need to support the new API calls to Claude 2, while the front-end will need to provide options for users to select between Claude 2 and GPT-4. The integration should ensure that Claude 2 can handle the same types of queries and tasks as GPT-4, providing a seamless user experience.

1. Integrate Claude 2 API (Back-end Developer)

Set up the back-end to use the Claude 2 API, following the API documentation for secure authentication and data handling.

Implement the necessary API calls to send and receive data from Claude 2.

Handle any API errors or failures, providing appropriate error messages to the user.

Test the API integration with valid and invalid data, and with different query scenarios.

2. Update Front-end for Claude 2 Integration (Front-end Developer)

Implement the user interface changes to allow users to select between Claude 2 and GPT-4.

Ensure the front-end can handle responses from both Claude 2 and GPT-4, displaying the results appropriately.

Test the front-end changes to ensure a seamless user experience when switching between Claude 2 and GPT-4.

3. Performance and Compatibility Testing (QA Engineer)

Test the performance of the RAG bot framework with Claude 2, ensuring it can handle the same load and types of queries as with GPT-4.

Ensure compatibility with existing features and functionalities of the RAG bot framework.

Conduct regression testing to ensure the integration does not introduce new issues.

Implementation Steps:

1. Integrate Claude 2 API:

Set up API authentication and data handling (sequential)

Implement API calls and handle errors (sequential)

Test API integration with various data scenarios (parallelizable)

2. Update Front-end for Claude 2 Integration:

Implement user interface changes (sequential)

Ensure compatibility with both Claude 2 and GPT-4 (sequential)

Test front-end changes for seamless user experience (parallelizable)

3. Performance and Compatibility Testing:

Conduct performance testing with Claude 2 (parallelizable)

Ensure compatibility with existing features (sequential)

Conduct regression testing (parallelizable)

The integration of Claude 2 into the RAG bot framework can be implemented by a team of back-end and front-end developers, along with a QA engineer. The steps should be done sequentially to ensure a smooth integration, with some testing steps parallelizable to save time.

Scenarios:

1. Access and Configure Claude 2:

Precondition: The developer has access to the RAG bot framework and Claude 2 API credentials.

User Action: The developer configures the RAG bot framework to use Claude 2.

Expected Outcome: The system is configured to use Claude 2 as an alternative to GPT-4.

Postcondition: The developer can proceed with testing the integration.

2. Handle API Errors:

Precondition: The system is configured to use Claude 2.

User Action: The system encounters an error while calling the Claude 2 API.

Expected Outcome: The system displays an appropriate error message and suggests possible actions (e.g., retry, check API credentials).

Postcondition: The developer is informed of the error and can take corrective actions.

3. Switch Between Claude 2 and GPT-4:

Precondition: The system supports both Claude 2 and GPT-4.

User Action: The user selects Claude 2 as the preferred bot engine.

Expected Outcome: The system switches to using Claude 2 for handling queries.

Postcondition: The user can interact with the bot using Claude 2.

4. Performance Testing:

Precondition: The system is set up to use Claude 2.

User Action: Multiple users simultaneously interact with the bot using Claude 2.

Expected Outcome: The system handles the concurrent requests efficiently without significant delays or crashes.

Postcondition: The system's performance with Claude 2 is validated.

5. Regression Testing:

Precondition: The system is integrated with Claude 2.

User Action: The QA engineer conducts regression testing to ensure existing features are not affected.

Expected Outcome: The system passes all regression tests without introducing new issues.

Postcondition: The integration is confirmed to be stable and reliable.
