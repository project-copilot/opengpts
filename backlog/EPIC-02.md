## Title
Create RAG Bots Using GPT-4 and Claude 2

## Description

Objective:
The primary goal of this epic is to develop two Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bots, leveraging GPT-4 and Claude 2, respectively. These bots will be designed to enhance our system's ability to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses by integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative AI models. The performance of these bots will be evaluated based on the criteria established in the first epic, focusing on accuracy, response time, and user satisfaction.

Scope:
This epic includes several key initiatives:

Bot Development: Create two separate RAG bots, one utilizing GPT-4 and the other using Claude 2, ensuring both are capable of retrieving relevant information and generating coherent responses.

Integration with Existing Systems: Ensure seamless integration of the RAG bots with our current infrastructure, including databases and user interfaces.

Performance Evaluation: Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess the bots' performance against predefined criteria, including accuracy, response time, and user satisfaction.

User Testing and Feedback: Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on the bots' performance and usability, and iterate on the design based on this feedback.

Documentation and Training: Provide detailed documentation and training materials to facilitate the deployment and maintenance of the RAG bots.

Acceptance Criteria:

Successful deployment of both GPT-4 and Claude 2 RAG bots.

Integration with existing systems without significant disruptions.

Positive user feedback indicating improved response accuracy and relevance.

Measurable improvements in response time and user satisfaction metrics.

Comprehensive documentation and training materials available for stakeholders.

Implementation Strategy:

The strategy involves a phased approach to development, starting with the creation of the core retrieval and generation functionalities. Each phase will follow Agile methodologies, with continuous integration and deployment to allow for iterative testing and refinement based on user feedback and performance metrics.

Milestones:

Research and Planning: Conduct initial research on RAG methodologies and plan the development process.

Development and Testing: Implement the core functionalities of the RAG bots, followed by rigorous testing for accuracy and performance.

Integration and User Testing: Integrate the bots with existing systems and conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback.

Launch and Evaluation: Deploy the bots to the production environment, monitor performance, and collect user feedback for ongoing improvements.

Dependencies:

Collaboration between AI research, development, and UX/UI design teams.

Integration with existing databases and user interfaces.

Use of analytics tools to measure performance and user satisfaction post-launch.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

Technical Challenges: Ensure robust testing and have contingency plans for rollbacks if issues arise.

User Resistance: Monitor feedback closely and be prepared to iterate on features based on user input.

Performance Impact: Optimize the bots for minimal impact on system performance and responsiveness.
