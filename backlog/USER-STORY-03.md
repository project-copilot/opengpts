## Title
Run G-Eval tests and generate detailed report

## Description

User:
As a user of the evaluation system

Action:
I want to run G-Eval tests using my criteria and view the evaluation results in a detailed report

Outcome:
So that I can analyze the evaluation results effectively and make data-driven decisions

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The user should be able to navigate to the G-Eval test execution feature within the evaluation system.
2. The system should allow the user to input their criteria for running G-Eval tests.
3. The backend should handle the execution of G-Eval tests based on the provided criteria.
4. The system should generate a detailed report of the evaluation results, including scores and relevant metrics.
5. The frontend should display the evaluation results in a clear and detailed manner, using charts and graphs for visualization.
6. The user should be able to download the detailed report in a PDF format.

Technical Reference:

The implementation of the G-Eval test execution and reporting feature requires changes to both the front-end and back-end systems. The front-end will need to provide an interface for inputting criteria and displaying results, while the back-end will handle the actual evaluation using G-Eval and integrate it with the existing evaluation framework.

1. Input Criteria for G-Eval Tests (Front-end Developer)

Create a user interface component to input criteria for G-Eval tests.

Ensure the component is user-friendly and provides clear instructions.

Validate the input criteria to ensure they are within acceptable parameters.

Test the input component with various criteria to ensure robustness.

2. Execute G-Eval Tests (Back-end Developer)

Integrate G-Eval with the existing evaluation framework.

Implement the logic to execute G-Eval tests based on the provided criteria.

Handle any errors or exceptions during the test execution, providing appropriate error messages.

Test the execution process with different criteria to ensure accuracy and reliability.

3. Generate Detailed Report (Back-end Developer)

Implement the logic to generate a detailed report of the evaluation results.

Ensure the report includes scores, relevant metrics, and visualizations (charts and graphs).

Provide an option to download the report in PDF format.

Test the report generation process to ensure completeness and correctness.

4. Display Evaluation Results (Front-end Developer)

Create a user interface component to display the evaluation results.

Use charts and graphs to visualize the scores and metrics.

Ensure the component is user-friendly and provides clear feedback.

Integrate the component with the existing evaluation system.

Test the display component to ensure it works seamlessly and does not disrupt the user experience.

Implementation Steps:

1. Input Criteria for G-Eval Tests:

Create and validate the input component (sequential)

Test the input component with various criteria (parallelizable)
2. Execute G-Eval Tests:

Integrate G-Eval with the evaluation framework (sequential)

Implement and test the execution logic (sequential)
3. Generate Detailed Report:

Implement the report generation logic (sequential)

Ensure the report includes visualizations and is downloadable (sequential)

Test the report generation process (parallelizable)
4. Display Evaluation Results:

Create and integrate the display component (sequential)

Ensure user-friendly interface and feedback (sequential)

Test the display component (parallelizable)

The G-Eval test execution and reporting feature can be implemented by a team of front-end and back-end developers familiar with the evaluation system and G-Eval. The steps should be done sequentially to ensure a smooth user experience, with some testing steps parallelizable to save time.

Scenarios:

1. Navigate to G-Eval Test Execution Feature:

Precondition: The user is logged into the evaluation system.

User Action: The user navigates through the system menu to find and select the G-Eval test execution feature.

Expected Outcome: The system displays the G-Eval test execution interface.

Postcondition: The user is ready to input criteria for running G-Eval tests.

2. Input Criteria for G-Eval Tests:

Precondition: The user is on the G-Eval test execution interface.

User Action: The user inputs their criteria for running G-Eval tests.

Expected Outcome: The system validates the input criteria and prepares for test execution.

Postcondition: The criteria are accepted, and the user can initiate the test execution.

3. Execute G-Eval Tests:

Precondition: The user has input valid criteria for G-Eval tests.

User Action: The user initiates the G-Eval test execution.

Expected Outcome: The system executes the G-Eval tests based on the provided criteria.

Postcondition: The evaluation results are generated and ready for reporting.

4. Generate Detailed Report:

Precondition: The G-Eval tests have been executed successfully.

User Action: The system generates a detailed report of the evaluation results.

Expected Outcome: The report includes scores, relevant metrics, and visualizations.

Postcondition: The report is available for viewing and download.

5. Display Evaluation Results:

Precondition: The detailed report has been generated.

User Action: The user views the evaluation results on the system interface.

Expected Outcome: The system displays the results in a clear and detailed manner, using charts and graphs.

Postcondition: The user understands the evaluation results and can make informed decisions.

6. Download Detailed Report:

Precondition: The detailed report has been generated.

User Action: The user opts to download the report in PDF format.

Expected Outcome: The system provides the report for download.

Postcondition: The user has a downloadable copy of the detailed report.

7. Handle Input Validation Error:

Precondition: The user is inputting criteria for G-Eval tests.

User Action: The user inputs invalid or incomplete criteria.

Expected Outcome: The system displays an error message indicating the validation issue.

Postcondition: The user is informed of the error and can correct the input criteria.

8. Handle Test Execution Error:

Precondition: The user has initiated the G-Eval test execution.

User Action: There is an issue during the test execution (e.g., system error).

Expected Outcome: The system displays an error message indicating the test execution failure.

Postcondition: The user is informed of the error and can take corrective actions.

9. Performance Testing:

Precondition: The system is set up to execute G-Eval tests and generate reports.

User Action: Multiple users simultaneously initiate the G-Eval test execution and report generation processes.

Expected Outcome: The system handles the concurrent requests efficiently without significant delays or crashes.

Postcondition: The system's performance under load is validated.

10. Security Testing:
