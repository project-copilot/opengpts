## Title
Evaluate GPT-4 and Claude RAG bots using the G-Eval framework

## Description
User:
As a user evaluating AI models

Action:
I want to evaluate both GPT-4 and Claude RAG bots using the G-Eval framework

Outcome:
So that I can determine which bot performs better based on my criteria

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The user should be able to navigate to the evaluation feature within the application.
2. The system should provide an option to select which bot to evaluate, such as a dropdown menu or similar selection tool.
3. The evaluation process should be consistent and capture detailed logs for each test.
4. The system should allow the user to view and compare the evaluation results of both bots.

Technical Reference:

The implementation of the evaluation feature requires changes to both the front-end interface and the integration with the G-Eval framework. The front-end will need to provide a selection tool for choosing the bot to evaluate and display the evaluation results. The back-end will need to handle the evaluation process, log the results, and ensure consistency.

1. Implement Bot Selection (Front-end Developer)

Add a dropdown menu or similar selection tool to the user interface for choosing between GPT-4 and Claude RAG bots.

Ensure the selection tool is user-friendly and integrates seamlessly with the existing application.

Test the selection tool to ensure it functions correctly and provides clear feedback to the user.

2. Integrate G-Eval Framework (Back-end Developer)

Set up the back-end to interface with the G-Eval framework, following the framework's guidelines for secure and efficient evaluation.

Implement the evaluation process to run tests on the selected bot and capture detailed logs.

Handle any errors or failures during the evaluation process, providing appropriate error messages to the user.

Test the evaluation process with both bots to ensure consistency and accuracy.

3. Display Evaluation Results (Front-end Developer)

Create a user interface component to display the evaluation results, including detailed logs and comparison metrics.

Ensure the component is user-friendly and provides clear instructions and feedback.

Integrate the component with the existing application.

Test the display component to ensure it works seamlessly and does not disrupt the user experience.

Implementation Steps:

1. Implement Bot Selection:

Add and integrate the selection tool (sequential)

Test the selection tool (sequential)
2. Integrate G-Eval Framework:

Set up G-Eval framework integration (sequential)

Implement and test the evaluation process (sequential)
3. Display Evaluation Results:

Create and integrate the display component (sequential)

Ensure user-friendly interface and feedback (sequential)

Test the display component (parallelizable)

The evaluation feature can be implemented by a team of front-end and back-end developers familiar with the G-Eval framework and the application architecture. The steps should be done sequentially to ensure a smooth user experience, with some testing steps parallelizable to save time.

Scenarios:

1. Navigate to Evaluation Feature:

Precondition: The user is logged into the application.

User Action: The user navigates through the app menu to find and select the evaluation feature.

Expected Outcome: The system displays the evaluation interface.

Postcondition: The user is ready to select a bot for evaluation.

2. Select Bot for Evaluation:

Precondition: The user is on the evaluation interface.

User Action: The user selects either GPT-4 or Claude RAG bot from the dropdown menu.

Expected Outcome: The system registers the selected bot and prepares for evaluation.

Postcondition: The user can initiate the evaluation process.

3. Initiate Evaluation Process:

Precondition: The user has selected a bot for evaluation.

User Action: The user initiates the evaluation process.

Expected Outcome: The system runs the evaluation using the G-Eval framework and captures detailed logs.

Postcondition: The evaluation results are available for display.

4. Handle Evaluation Error:

Precondition: The user has initiated the evaluation process.

User Action: The evaluation process encounters an error (e.g., network issue).

Expected Outcome: The system displays an error message indicating the evaluation failure and suggests possible actions (e.g., retry, check internet connection).

Postcondition: The user is informed of the error and can take corrective actions.

5. Display Evaluation Results:

Precondition: The evaluation process has completed successfully.

User Action: The user views the evaluation results on the app interface.

Expected Outcome: The system displays the evaluation results, including detailed logs and comparison metrics, in a user-friendly manner.

Postcondition: The user can analyze the results and determine which bot performs better based on their criteria.

6. Compare Evaluation Results:

Precondition: The user has evaluation results for both GPT-4 and Claude RAG bots.

User Action: The user compares the evaluation results to determine which bot performs better.

Expected Outcome: The system provides a clear comparison of the evaluation results, highlighting key performance metrics.

Postcondition: The user can make an informed decision based on the comparison.

7. Performance Testing:

Precondition: The system is set up to run evaluations and display results.

User Action: Multiple users simultaneously initiate the evaluation process.

Expected Outcome: The system handles the concurrent requests efficiently without significant delays or crashes.

Postcondition: The system's performance under load is validated.

8. Security Testing:

Precondition: The system is integrated with the G-Eval framework and handles user data.

User Action: Attempt to access the evaluation feature without proper authentication or authorization.

Expected Outcome: The system prevents unauthorized access and displays an appropriate error message.

Postcondition: The system's security measures are validated, ensuring only authorized users can access the feature.
