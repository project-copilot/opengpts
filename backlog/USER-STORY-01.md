## Title
G-Eval Configuration Panel

## Description

User:
As a user of the OpenGPTs platform

Action:
I want to access the G-Eval Configuration Panel from the main OpenGPTs UI

Outcome:
So that I can start setting up my evaluation criteria

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The user should be able to navigate to the G-Eval Configuration Panel from the main OpenGPTs UI.
2. The panel should allow users to define custom evaluation criteria through a form.
3. The form should include fields for questions, expected answers, and criteria selection.
4. The panel should be intuitive and user-friendly.
5. Tooltips should be available to guide users through the setup process.

Technical Reference:

The implementation of the G-Eval Configuration Panel requires changes to the front-end UI of the OpenGPTs platform. The front-end developer will need to create a new panel accessible from the main UI, design the form for custom evaluation criteria, and ensure the user interface is intuitive and user-friendly. Tooltips should be added to assist users in navigating the setup process.

1. Create G-Eval Configuration Panel (Front-end Developer)

Design and implement a new panel accessible from the main OpenGPTs UI.

Ensure the panel is integrated seamlessly with the existing UI.

Test the panel's accessibility and navigation.

2. Design Custom Evaluation Criteria Form (Front-end Developer)

Implement a form within the panel that includes fields for questions, expected answers, and criteria selection.

Ensure the form is user-friendly and intuitive.

Test the form with various input scenarios to ensure it functions correctly.

3. Add Tooltips for User Guidance (Front-end Developer)

Implement tooltips to guide users through the setup process.

Ensure the tooltips are informative and enhance the user experience.

Test the tooltips to ensure they appear at the right time and provide useful information.

Implementation Steps:

1. Create G-Eval Configuration Panel:

Design and implement the new panel (sequential)

Integrate the panel with the main OpenGPTs UI (sequential)

Test the panel's accessibility and navigation (parallelizable)

2. Design Custom Evaluation Criteria Form:

Implement the form with required fields (sequential)

Ensure the form is user-friendly (sequential)

Test the form with various input scenarios (parallelizable)

3. Add Tooltips for User Guidance:

Implement tooltips in the panel (sequential)

Ensure tooltips are informative and user-friendly (sequential)

Test the tooltips for accuracy and usefulness (parallelizable)

The G-Eval Configuration Panel can be implemented by a single front-end developer familiar with the OpenGPTs platform and UI design principles. The steps should be done sequentially to ensure a smooth user experience, with some testing steps parallelizable to save time.

Scenarios:

1. Navigate to G-Eval Configuration Panel:

Precondition: The user is logged into the OpenGPTs platform.

User Action: The user navigates through the main UI to find and select the G-Eval Configuration Panel.

Expected Outcome: The system displays the G-Eval Configuration Panel.

Postcondition: The user is ready to set up their evaluation criteria.

2. Define Custom Evaluation Criteria:

Precondition: The user is in the G-Eval Configuration Panel.

User Action: The user fills out the form with questions, expected answers, and criteria selection.

Expected Outcome: The system accepts the input and saves the custom evaluation criteria.

Postcondition: The user has successfully set up their evaluation criteria.

3. Use Tooltips for Guidance:

Precondition: The user is in the G-Eval Configuration Panel.

User Action: The user hovers over or clicks on tooltip icons for guidance.

Expected Outcome: The system displays informative tooltips to assist the user.

Postcondition: The user is guided through the setup process and understands how to use the panel.

4. Handle Invalid Input:

Precondition: The user is filling out the form in the G-Eval Configuration Panel.

User Action: The user enters invalid or incomplete data.

Expected Outcome: The system displays an error message indicating the issue and prompts the user to correct the input.

Postcondition: The user is informed of the input issue and can take corrective actions.

5. Performance Testing:

Precondition: The system is set up to handle multiple users accessing the G-Eval Configuration Panel.

User Action: Multiple users simultaneously access and use the panel.

Expected Outcome: The system handles the concurrent requests efficiently without significant delays or crashes.

Postcondition: The system's performance under load is validated.

6. Security Testing:

Precondition: The system is integrated with the OpenGPTs platform and handles user data.

User Action: Attempt to access the G-Eval Configuration Panel without proper authentication or authorization.

Expected Outcome: The system prevents unauthorized access and displays an appropriate error message.

Postcondition: The system's security measures are validated, ensuring only authorized users can access the panel.
