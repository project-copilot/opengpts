## Title
Input evaluation criteria and save to reuse

## Description

User:
As a user of the evaluation system

Action:
I want to input my evaluation criteria and save it

Outcome:
So that I can reuse it for future evaluations

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The user should be able to navigate to the evaluation criteria input feature within the evaluation system.
2. The system should provide a form for the user to input their evaluation criteria.
3. The system should validate the completeness and correctness of the input criteria before saving.
4. The system should save the validated evaluation criteria to the backend.
5. The user should be able to retrieve and reuse the saved evaluation criteria for future evaluations.

Technical Reference:

The implementation of the evaluation criteria input and save feature requires changes to both the front-end and back-end systems. The front-end will need to provide a user interface for inputting criteria and handle validation. The back-end will need to support storing and retrieving the criteria through a new endpoint.

1. Input Evaluation Criteria (Front-end Developer)

Create a user interface form for inputting evaluation criteria.

Implement client-side validation to ensure completeness and correctness of the input criteria.

Handle any input errors, providing appropriate feedback to the user.

Test the input form with various criteria to ensure robustness.

2. Save Evaluation Criteria (Back-end Developer)

Implement a new endpoint to handle saving evaluation criteria.

Ensure the endpoint validates the received criteria before saving.

Store the validated criteria in the database.

Test the endpoint with valid and invalid data to ensure reliability.

3. Retrieve Evaluation Criteria (Back-end Developer)

Implement a new endpoint to handle retrieving saved evaluation criteria.

Ensure the endpoint retrieves the correct criteria for the user.

Test the retrieval process to ensure accuracy and performance.

4. Display Saved Criteria (Front-end Developer)

Create a user interface component to display the saved evaluation criteria.

Ensure the component is user-friendly and provides clear instructions and feedback.

Integrate the component with the existing evaluation system.

Test the display component to ensure it works seamlessly and does not disrupt the user experience.

Implementation Steps:

1. Input Evaluation Criteria:

Create and validate the input form (sequential)

Handle input errors and test the form (sequential)
2. Save Evaluation Criteria:

Implement the save endpoint (sequential)

Validate and store the criteria (sequential)

Test the save process (parallelizable)
3. Retrieve Evaluation Criteria:

Implement the retrieve endpoint (sequential)

Test the retrieval process (parallelizable)
4. Display Saved Criteria:

Create and integrate the display component (sequential)

Ensure user-friendly interface and feedback (sequential)

Test the display component (parallelizable)

The evaluation criteria input and save feature can be implemented by a team of front-end and back-end developers. The steps should be done sequentially to ensure a smooth user experience, with some testing steps parallelizable to save time.

Scenarios:

1. Navigate to Evaluation Criteria Input Feature:

Precondition: The user is logged into the evaluation system.

User Action: The user navigates through the system menu to find and select the evaluation criteria input feature.

Expected Outcome: The system displays the evaluation criteria input form.

Postcondition: The user is ready to input their evaluation criteria.

2. Input Evaluation Criteria:

Precondition: The user is on the evaluation criteria input form.

User Action: The user inputs their evaluation criteria into the form.

Expected Outcome: The system validates the input criteria for completeness and correctness.

Postcondition: The user receives feedback on the input criteria.

3. Save Evaluation Criteria:

Precondition: The user has input valid evaluation criteria.

User Action: The user submits the evaluation criteria for saving.

Expected Outcome: The system saves the validated criteria to the backend.

Postcondition: The user is informed that the criteria have been successfully saved.

4. Retrieve Saved Evaluation Criteria:

Precondition: The user has previously saved evaluation criteria.

User Action: The user initiates the retrieval of saved evaluation criteria.

Expected Outcome: The system retrieves and displays the saved criteria.

Postcondition: The user can view and reuse the saved evaluation criteria.

5. Handle Input Validation Error:

Precondition: The user is inputting evaluation criteria.

User Action: The user submits incomplete or incorrect criteria.

Expected Outcome: The system displays an error message indicating the validation failure and suggests corrective actions.

Postcondition: The user is informed of the validation error and can correct the input criteria.

6. Performance Testing:

Precondition: The system is set up to save and retrieve evaluation criteria.

User Action: Multiple users simultaneously input and save evaluation criteria.

Expected Outcome: The system handles the concurrent requests efficiently without significant delays or crashes.

Postcondition: The system's performance under load is validated.

7. Security Testing:

Precondition: The system is integrated with the backend for saving and retrieving criteria.

User Action: Attempt to save or retrieve evaluation criteria without proper authentication or authorization.

Expected Outcome: The system prevents unauthorized access and displays an appropriate error message.

Postcondition: The system's security measures are validated, ensuring only authorized users can save and retrieve criteria.
