## Title
Integrate GPT-4 into our RAG bot framework

## Description

User:
As a developer

Action:
I want to integrate GPT-4 into our RAG bot framework

Outcome:
So that I can create a bot that uses the latest language model

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The developer should be able to access the GPT-4 integration feature within the RAG bot framework.
2. The system should establish a connection with the GPT-4 API and authenticate using secure credentials.
3. The system should be able to send queries to the GPT-4 API and receive responses.
4. The system should handle and log any errors or exceptions that occur during the API interaction.
5. The bot should utilize the responses from GPT-4 to generate appropriate and contextually relevant replies.

Technical Reference:

The integration of GPT-4 into the RAG bot framework requires modifications to both the back-end server and the bot's interaction logic. The back-end server will need to handle API requests to GPT-4, manage authentication, and process responses. The bot's interaction logic will need to be updated to incorporate the responses from GPT-4 into its dialogue flow.

1. Establish Connection with GPT-4 API (Back-end Developer)

Set up secure authentication with the GPT-4 API, following OpenAI's guidelines.

Implement the API request and response handling.

Handle any errors or exceptions during the API interaction.

Test the connection with valid and invalid credentials.

2. Update Bot Interaction Logic (Back-end Developer)

Modify the bot's dialogue flow to include responses from GPT-4.

Ensure the bot can handle various types of responses and integrate them contextually.

Test the bot's interaction with different queries to ensure relevance and coherence.

3. Error Handling and Logging (Back-end Developer)

Implement error handling for API request failures, timeouts, and invalid responses.

Log errors and exceptions for monitoring and debugging purposes.

Provide fallback mechanisms in case of API failures to maintain bot functionality.

Implementation Steps:

1. Establish Connection with GPT-4 API:

Set up API authentication and request handling (sequential)

Handle and log errors during API interaction (sequential)

Test the connection with different scenarios (parallelizable)

2. Update Bot Interaction Logic:

Modify dialogue flow to include GPT-4 responses (sequential)

Test bot interactions with various queries (parallelizable)

3. Error Handling and Logging:

Implement error handling and logging mechanisms (sequential)

Test error handling with different failure scenarios (parallelizable)

The integration of GPT-4 into the RAG bot framework can be implemented by a back-end developer familiar with API integrations and bot frameworks. The steps should be done sequentially to ensure a smooth integration, with some testing steps parallelizable to save time.

Scenarios:

1. Access GPT-4 Integration Feature:

Precondition: The developer has access to the RAG bot framework.

User Action: The developer navigates to the GPT-4 integration feature.

2. Establish Connection with GPT-4 API:

Precondition: The developer has valid API credentials.

User Action: The developer initiates the connection setup with the GPT-4 API.

Expected Outcome: The system successfully establishes a connection and authenticates with the GPT-4 API.

Postcondition: The connection is ready for sending queries.

3. Handle API Request Error:

Precondition: The developer has initiated an API request.

User Action: The system encounters an error during the API request (e.g., network error).

Expected Outcome: The system logs the error and provides an appropriate error message.

Postcondition: The developer is informed of the error and can take corrective actions.

4. Send Query to GPT-4 API:

Precondition: The system has established a connection with the GPT-4 API.

User Action: The developer sends a query to the GPT-4 API.

Expected Outcome: The system receives a response from the GPT-4 API.

Postcondition: The response is available for the bot to use.

5. Update Bot Dialogue Flow:

Precondition: The system has received a response from the GPT-4 API.

User Action: The bot integrates the response into its dialogue flow.

Expected Outcome: The bot generates a contextually relevant reply using the GPT-4 response.

Postcondition: The bot's interaction is enhanced with GPT-4's capabilities.

6. Test Bot Interaction:

Precondition: The bot's dialogue flow has been updated.

User Action: The developer tests the bot with various queries.

Expected Outcome: The bot provides relevant and coherent replies using GPT-4 responses.

Postcondition: The bot's functionality with GPT-4 is validated.

7. Log API Interaction:

Precondition: The system is interacting with the GPT-4 API.
