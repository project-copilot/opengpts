**Attendees:** Alice (PM), Bob (Lead Developer), Carol (QA Engineer), Dave (Data Scientist)

**Alice:** Welcome, team. Today we're discussing the OpenGPTs project, specifically the new Model Comparison Module. Our main goal is to create a system that can compare different AI models using common documents and predefined questions. Let's outline our main epic and user stories.

**Bob:** For the epic, how about "AI Model Comparison Framework for OpenGPTs"?

**Alice:** Perfect. Now, let's brainstorm some user stories.

**Carol:** We need a way for users to upload documents. Something like, "As a user, I want to upload a document so that the models can provide information from it."

**Dave:** We should also have a story for setting up predefined questions. Maybe, "As a user, I want to set predefined questions that guide the models in generating responses."

**Bob:** And of course, we need the actual comparison functionality. "As a user, I want to compare the responses of different models based on metrics like ROUGE-1 and G-Eval scores."

**Alice:** Excellent. Let's use these as a starting point for our backlog.
